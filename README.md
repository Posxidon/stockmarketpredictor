Stock Market Predictor
This repository contains code for a stock market predictor that utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast stock market trends. The predictor is built using Python and employs various libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

Technologies and Libraries Used:
The following technologies and libraries are utilized in this project:

Python: The code is written in Python, a popular programming language for data analysis and machine learning.

yfinance: The yfinance library is used to fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance.

pandas: The pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis.

scikit-learn: The scikit-learn library is employed for machine learning tasks, specifically for implementing the random forest classifier.

sklearn.metrics: The precision_score function from the sklearn.metrics module is used to evaluate the precision of the classifier model.

Matplotlib: The plot function from the matplotlib library is utilized to create line plots.

Usage:
To use the stock market predictor, follow these steps:

Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the provided code, preferably in a Python environment.

The code retrieves stock market data using the yfinance library and performs data preprocessing.

It builds a random forest classifier model and trains it on the available data.

The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test data.

The precision score is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model.

Additionally, the code implements a backtesting function to assess the model's predictions over different time horizons.

Results and Analysis:
The code generates predictions for stock market trends based on the provided data. It evaluates the precision score of the predictions and provides visualizations to compare the actual and predicted trends.
