# <span style="font-size:larger;">Stock Market Predictor</span>

This repository contains code for a stock market predictor that utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast stock market trends. The predictor is built using Python and employs various libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Technologies and Libraries Used</span>

The following technologies and libraries are utilized in this project:

- Python: The code is written in Python, a popular programming language for data analysis and machine learning.

- yfinance: The `yfinance` library is used to fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance.

- pandas: The `pandas` library is used for data manipulation and analysis.

- scikit-learn: The `scikit-learn` library is employed for machine learning tasks, specifically for implementing the random forest classifier.

- sklearn.metrics: The `precision_score` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module is used to evaluate the precision of the classifier model.

- Matplotlib: The `plot` function from the `matplotlib` library is utilized to create line plots.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Usage</span>

To use the stock market predictor, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Run the provided code, preferably in a Python environment.

4. The code retrieves stock market data using the `yfinance` library and performs data preprocessing.

5. It builds a random forest classifier model and trains it on the available data.

6. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test data.

7. The precision score is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model.

8. Additionally, the code implements a backtesting function to assess the model's predictions over different time horizons.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Results and Analysis</span>

The code generates predictions for stock market trends based on the provided data. It evaluates the precision score of the predictions and provides visualizations to compare the actual and predicted trends.
